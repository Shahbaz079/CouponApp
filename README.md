## Abuse Prevention Strategies

To prevent multiple coupon claims:
- **IP Tracking**: Each claim is linked to the user's IP and stored in the database. If the same IP tries to claim another coupon within an hour, they are blocked.
- **Cookie Tracking**: A cookie is set when a coupon is claimed, preventing users from claiming again even if they switch networks or refresh the page.



## How to Claim a Coupon?
1. Visit the website.
2. Click the "Claim Coupon" button.
3. If successful, you'll receive a coupon code.
4. If you've already claimed one, you'll see a message telling you when you can try again.
